- To create Custom Actions, you need to edit this file. Changes will be applied after saving and relaunching the script.
To relaunch the script, you need to either relaunch Live, open an existing Live set or create a new one.

- You can create "default" Custom Actions in this file by following this model (the # needs to be removed to uncomment) :

# CUSTOM_ACTION[1] = METRO ; 1/ MUTE ON; 2/ ARM, CLIP2 PLAY ; MST/ VOLUME >2 

The line above means that if you set a Button to 'Custom Action 1' in the Editor, the following things will happen when the button is pressed :
· The Metronome state will toggle, 
· Track 1 will be muted, 
· Track 2 will be armed and the Clip 2 will play , 
· The Master volume will be set 2dB up.

- To add more Custom Actions, add more lines and change the number in the brackets [] :

# CUSTOM_ACTION[2] = 2/ MUTE ; SETSTOP ;
# CUSTOM_ACTION[3] = 3/ STOP ; REC ;
...

You can have up to 120 Custom Actions.
If a Custom Action number is declared several times, only the last one is taken into account.

- You can change or add Custom Actions from within a Live set by adding (CAn); to a Clip name, where n is the Custom Action number.
The new action will be updated when the Clip is playing.
So playing a Clip named : 
(CA1) ; 3/ MUTE ; 4/ ARM
will change the Custom Action 1 to Mute Track 3 and Arm Track 4
If the Clip starts with [] and you have ClyphX or ClyphX Pro installed, the corresponding ClyphX action will be executed.

- For a complete list of actions, refer to the User Manual.
- Custom Actions follow ClyphX syntax, so it is advised to have a look at the ClyphX manual for a deeper use.

Add your actions below this line.
